### Reflection

This was pretty simple to make. At first some of the different things in Onshape were hard to follow but I was able to catch on pretty quickly.

The next piece was the mount that attaches to the base.

This piece was simple to make. I like how Onshape makes things very practical and save all our work.

This is the piece that connects to the mount and holds the wheel.

### Reflection
Making this in Onshape was pretty easy. The mirror was very simple and it always knows what you want to do which is helpful.

This was the tire that goes around the wheel.

The revolve was cool to figure out, pretty simple.

### Reflection
This was pretty simple, when I was creating the spokes I had a little trouble because it wouldn't select the correct thing when I tried to cut. But I redid the drawing and it worked.

## AxleCollarBearings

### Description
This is the ale collar and bearings that go on the wheel and connect everything.

### Reflection
This was really cool to see that you could make one part on another and use the same geometry on the two parts.
